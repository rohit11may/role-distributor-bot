# role-distributor-bot
Distribute social deduction game roles (Mafia, Avalon etc) via a messenger bot

Deployed on a free tier heroku, so don't hit it with a barage of requests or it will work unreliably.
Text the bot [here](m.me/108499230905206) 'hello'.

The creator of the game is the owner, if the responses are unexpected then wait a little bit and text it again. Create the 
game first and then the creator adds the roles using the commands explained by the bot. Once the people have joined the game
and the roles have been added, the creator can text start to distribute the roles to the partcipants.
